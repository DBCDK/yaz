Compilation and installation for YAZ 
  $Id: README,v 1.19 1998-01-07 12:59:27 adam Exp $

The primary output of the source here is the lib/libyaz.a library,
which contains support functions for implementing the server or client
role of Z39.50/SR.

Windows programmers: refer to the file windows.txt which describes
how to compile the software using Microsoft Visual C++.

Two test-programs of interest are generated when you type 'make' at
the top level: ztest/ztest and client/client. Ztest is a dummy database
server which returns canned responses to all queries. It's good for
verifying that the protocol works ok, and ztest.c shows a minimalistic
implementation of the 'backend' interface.

Client is a linemode Z39.50 client. It supports a fair amount of the
functionality of Z39.50v2/SR, but some things you need to enable or disable
by recompilation. Its primary purpose is to excersise the package, and
verify that the protocol works OK. It can be started by typing

client tcp:<hostname>:<port>

at the UNIX prompt, to connect to a Z39.50 server, or

client osi:[<tsel>'/']<hostname>:<port>

to connect to an OSI SR target (this requires mOSI-support). To connect to
the DANBIB test target, you might use:

client osi:0103/find2.denet.dk:4500

Use '?' to get a list of the available commands.

The current query language is a bit awkward, but functional:

query     ::= ['@attrset' <attribute-set>] rpn
rpn       ::= complex | simple | attr rpn
complex   ::= operator rpn rpn
operator  ::= '@and' | '@or' | '@not' | '@prox' proximity
simple    ::= term | set.
term      ::= <word> | '"' <term> ... '"'.
set       ::= '@set' <setname>.
attr      ::= '@attr' [<attribute-set>] <number> '=' <number>.
proximity ::= exclusion distance ordered relation which unit
exclusion ::= '1' | '0' | 'void'
distance  ::= <number>
ordered   ::= '1' | '0'
relation  ::= <number>
which     ::= 'known' | 'private'
unit      ::= <number>

The directories:

doc     - Documentation.

util    - Various little utility functions. Logging, memory debugging,
	primitive ISO 2709 presentation for the client, etc.

odr     - Open Data Representation. This module implements the BER
	encoding rules. Documentation is found in the files odr-use.man
	and odr.txt.

asn     - This module implements the Z39.50/SR protocol. The best way
	to find out how it works is to look in the sample
	client/server code in server/seshigh.c or yazlib/tst.c. The
	interface is still wholly described by the file proto.h
	which defines structure and type definitions for each of the
	types introduced in the protocol specification.

comstack- This module implements the transport transparency
	stack (COMSTACK). The comstack implements a generic interface
	for exchanging BER-encoded records over a network. It supports
	the 'American' mode of exchanging the records straight over
	TCP/IP, and uses Peter Furniss' XTIMOSI package over RFC1006.
	Look for documentation in the file comstack.man.

rfc1006 - Xtimosi requires an implementation of the OSI transport
	layer with an XTI-based API. Some systems (HP and DEC,
	notably) provide this. For others, we provide an
	implementation of the RFC1006 protocol (which is what
	ISODE-based implementations often use). This module is not
	neeeded if you don't use xtimosi, and it's not included in the
	libyaz.a library.

server  - This is the implementation of the server frontend. It
	provides event-handling and server managament functions,
	and calls the backend primitives (best documentation of these
	is in the file include/backend.h). See server.txt.

client  - A demonstration client. If we come upon a good design for a
	higher level client API, that will live here.

ztest   - A demonstration server that implements a backend.

include - The various header files.

makelib - This is a simple utility that gathers the libraries from the
	previous modules into libyaz.a.

lib     - The libraries. Primarily libyaz.a.
