YAZ Compilation guidelines for winNT/95.

This distribution of YAZ was compiled with Visual C++ 5.0.
The workspace file, yaz.dsw, is located in the top-level directory.

It includes 4 sub-projects:
   yaz.dsp 
         Builds yaz.dll. This DLL includes the source in all
         sub directories except for 'server', 'client' and
         'ztest'. To export public functions the header files
         includes the modifier YAZ_EXPORT which is defined in
         yconfig.h. The value of this modifier,
          __declspec(dllexport), probably only works with VC.

   client/client.dsp   
         Builds client.exe as a console application. It links
         with the import library yaz.lib. This application 
         searches for yaz.dll during runtime.

   server/server.dsp
         Builds the library, server.lib, which includes the
         source from 'server'. Unlike the UNIX version, the
         server library is multi-threaded.

   ztest/ztest.dsp
         Builds ztest.exe as a console application. It links
         with the import library yaz.lib and the regular library
         server.lib. When running ztest make sure it is able to
         find the record test files dummy-records, dummy-grs,
         and dummy-words in the current directory. 

         As an option ztest may be installed as an NT service
         (not Windows 95). Use 'ztest -install <otherargs>' to
         install it and 'ztest -remove <otherargs>' to remove it
         again. Since NT runs the service program in some weird
         directory, such as \winnt\system32, it's probably a good
         idea to use the option '-w' to change to some other
         directory. For example

            ztest -install -w d:\proj\yaz\ztest -l ztest.out tcp:@:210

         which specifies both working directory and a log file, so
         you can see what's going on.
