 <chapter id="zoom"><title>Building clients with ZOOM</title>
  
  <para>
    &zoom; is an acronym for 'Z39.50 Object-Orientation Model' and is
   an initiative started by Mike Taylor (Mike is from the UK, which
   explains the peculiar name of the model). The goal of &zoom; is to
   provide a common Z39.50 client API not bound to a particular
   programming language or toolkit.
  </para>
  <para>
   The lack of a simple Z39.50 client API for &yaz; has become more
   and more apparent over time. So when the first ZOOM specification
   became available,
   an implementation for &yaz; was quickly developed. For the first time, it is
   now as easy (or easier!) to develop clients than servers with &yaz;. This
   chapter describes the ZOOM C binding. Before going futher, please
   reconsider whether C is the right programming language for the job.
   There are other language bindings available for &yaz;, and still
   more
   are in active development. See the ZOOM website at
   <ulink url="http://zoom.z3950.org/">zoom.z3950.org</ulink> for
   more information.
  </para>

  <para>
   In order to fully understand this chapter you should read and
   try the example programs <literal>zoomtst1.c</literal>,
   <literal>zoomtst2.c</literal>, .. in the <literal>zoom</literal>
   directory.
  </para>

  <para>
   The C language misses many features found in object oriented languages
   such as C++, Java, etc. For example, you'll have to manually,
   destroy all objects you create, even though you may think of them as
   temporary. Most objects has a <literal>_create</literal> - and a
   <literal>_destroy</literal> variant.
   All objects are in fact pointers to internal stuff, but you don't see
   that because of typedefs. All destroy methods should gracefully ignore a
   <literal>NULL</literal> pointer.
  </para>
  <para>
   In each of the sections below you'll find a sub section called
   protocol behavior, that descries how the API maps to the Z39.50
   protocol.

   <para>
    Connection objects are created with either function
    <function>Z3950_connection_new</function> or 
    <function>Z3950_connection_create</function>.
    The former creates and automatically attempts to establish a network
    connection with the target. The latter doesn't establish
    a connection immediately, thus allowing you to specify options
    before establishing network connection using the function
    <function>Z3950_connection_connect</function>. 
    If the portnumber, <literal>portnum</literal>, is zero, the
    <literal>host</literal> is consulted for a port specification.
    If no port is given, 210 is used. A colon denotes the beginning of
    a port number in the host string. If the host string includes a
    slash, the following part specifies a database for the connection.

   <para>
    The <function>Z3950_connection_option</function> allows you to
    inspect or set an option given by <parameter>key</parameter>
    for the connection.
    If <parameter>val</parameter> is non-<literal>NULL</literal> that
    holds the new value for option.
    Otherwise, if <parameter>val</parameter> is
    <literal>NULL</literal>,
    the option is unchanged.
    The function returns the previous value of the option.

    <para>
     The calls <function>Z3950_connection_new</function> and
     <function>Z3950_connection_connect</function> establises a TCP/IP
      connection and sends an Initialize Request to the target if
      possible. In addition, the calls waits for an Initialize Response
      from the target and the result is inspected (OK or rejected).
    </para>
    <para>
     If <literal>proxy</literal> is set then the client will establish
     a TCP/IP connection with the peer as specified by the
     <literal>proxy</literal> host and the hostname as part of the
     connect calls will be set as part of the Initialize Request.
     The proxy server will then "forward" the PDU's transparently
     to the target behind the proxy.
    </para>
    <para>
     For the authentication parameters, if option <literal>user</literal>
     is set and both options <literal>group</literal> and
     <literal>pass</literal> are unset, then Open style
     authentication is used (Version 2/3) in which case the username
     is usually followed by a slash, then by a password.
     If either <literal>group</literal>
     or <literal>pass</literal> is set then idPass authentication
     (Version 3 only) is used. If none of the options are set, no
     authentication parameters are set as part of the Initialize Request
     (obviously).
    </para>
    <para>
     When option <literal>async</literal> is 1, it really means that
     all network operations are postponed (and queued) until the
     function <literal>Z3950_event</literal> is invoked. When doing so
     it doesn't make sense to check for errors after
     <literal>Z3950_connection_new</literal> is called since that
     operation "connecting - and init" is still incomplete and the
     API cannot tell the outcome (yet).

    <title>Protocol behavior</title>
    <para>
     The creation of a result set involves at least a SearchRequest
     - SearchResponse protocol handshake. Following that, if a sort
     critieria was specified as part of the query, a sortRequest -
     SortResponse handshake takes place. Note that it is necessary to
     perform sorting before any retrieval takes place, so no records will
     be returned from the target as part of the SearchResponse because these
     would be unsorted. Hence, piggyback is disabled when sort critieria
     is set. Following Search - and a Possible sort, Retrieval takes
     place - as one or more Present Requests - Present Response being
     transferred.
     </para>
    <para>
     The API allows for two different modes for retrieval. A high level
     mode which is somewhat more powerful and a low level one.
     The low level is "enabled" when the settings
     <literal>smallSetUpperBound</literal>,
     <literal>mediumSetPresentNumber</literal> and
     <literal>largeSetLowerBound</literal> are set. The low level mode
     thus allows you to precisely set how records are returned as part
     of a search response as offered by the Z39.50 protocol.
     Since the client may be retrieving records as part of the
     search response, this mode doesn't work well if sorting is used.
     </para>
    <para>
     The high-level mode allows you to fetch a range of records from
     the result set with a given start offset. When you use this mode
     the client will automatically use piggyback if that is possible
     with the target and perform one or more present requests as needed.
     Even if the target returns fewer records as part of a present response
     because of a record size limit, etc. the client will repeat sending
     present requests. As an example, if option <literal>start</literal>
     is 0 (default) and <literal>count</literal> is 4, and
     <literal>piggyback</literal> is 1 (default) and no sorting critieria
     is specified, then the client will attempt to retrieve the 4
     records as part the search response (using piggyback). On the other
     hand, if either <literal>start</literal> is positive or if
     a sorting criteria is set, or if <literal>piggyback</literal>
     is 0, then the client will not perform piggyback but send Present
     Requests instead.
    </para>
    <para>
     If either of the options <literal>mediumSetElementSetName</literal> and
     <literal>smallSetElementSetName</literal> are unset, the value
     of option <literal>elementSetName</literal> is used for piggyback
     searches. This means that for the high-level mode you only have
     to specify one elementSetName option rather than three.

    int Z3950_event (int no, Z3950_connection *cs);

   <para>
    The <function>Z3950_event</function> executes pending events for
    a number of connections. Supply the number of connections in
    <literal>no</literal> and an array of connections in
    <literal>cs</literal> (<literal>cs[0] ... cs[no-1]</literal>).
    A pending event could be a sending a search, receiving a response,
    etc.
    When an event has a occured for one of the connections, this function
    returns a positive integer <literal>n</literal> denoting that an event
    occurred for connection <literal>cs[n-1]</literal>.
    When no events are pending for the connections, a value of zero is
    returned.
    To ensure that all outstanding requests are performed call this function
    repeatedly until zero is returned.
