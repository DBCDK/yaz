  <para>
   We have a new and better version of the front-end server on the drawing
   board. Resources and external commitments will govern when we'll be
   able to do something real with it. Features should include greater
   flexibility, greater support for access/resource control, and easy
   support for Explain (possibly with Zebra as an extra database engine).
  </para>

  <para>
   The 'retrieval' module needs to be finalized and documented. We think
   it can form a useful resource for people dealing with complex record
   structures, but for now, you'll mostly have to chew through the code
   yourself to make use of it. Not acceptable.
  </para>

  <para>
   &yaz; is a BER toolkit and as such should support all protocols
   out there based on that. We'd like to see running ILL applications.
   It shouldn't be that hard. Another thing that would be intersting is
   LDAP. Maybe a generic framework for doing IR using both LDAP and
   Z39.50 transparently.
  </para>

  <para>
   Other than that, YAZ generally moves in the directions which appear to
   make the most people happy (including ourselves, as prime users of the
   software). If there's something you'd like to see in here, then drop
   us a note and let's see what we can come up with.
