  <para>
   We have a new and better version of the front-end server on the drawing
   board. Resources and external commitments will govern when we'll be
   able to do something real with it. Features should include greater
   flexibility, greater support for access/resource control, and easy
   support for Explain (possibly with Zebra as an extra database engine).
  </para>

  <para>
   We now support all PDUs of Z39.50-1995. If there is one of the
   supporting structures that you need but can't find in the prt*.h
   files, send us a note; it may be on its way.
  </para>

  <para>
   The 'retrieval' module needs to be finalized and documented. We think
   it can form a useful resource for people dealing with complex record
   structures, but for now, you'll mostly have to chew through the code
   yourself to make use of it. Not acceptable.
  </para>

  <para>
   Other than that, YAZ generally moves in the directions which appear to
   make the most people happy (including ourselves, as prime users of the
   software). If there's something you'd like to see in here, then drop
   us a note and let's see what we can come up with.
