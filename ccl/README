CCL test module

This module is required to parse the queries given to the yaz-client
test program. It is *not* a part of the YAZ module, and it is
distributed under a different license.

Eventually, the products of the EUROPAGATE will be made available to
the general public, free of charge (the exact nature of the license is
unknown at this point). Until then, you should *NOT* distribute copies
of this software to organisations that are not partners in EUROPAGATE.

If you need to distribute copies of YAZ to organisations which are not
partners in EUROPAGATE, you should remove this module, and, if
necessary, modify client/yaz-client.c to work wihout it. The test program
is not essential to the general working of YAZ.
