 * \brief NFA for character set normalizing
 *
 * The NFA is a character mathcing device. It consists of states
 * and transitions between them. Each transition has a condition, which
 * is a range of values.
 *
 * When matching, we always start at the first state, and find the longest
 * possible sequence of input characters that match the ranges in the
 * conditions, and that leads into a terminal state.
