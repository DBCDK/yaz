--- 1.0b3 1995/08/24

Fixed bug in the frontend-server. The numberOfRecordsReturned field was
handled incorrectly when records were requested in the searchResponse. This
will only affect you if you use the frontend-server.

Added Explain encoders/decoders to the service-level API. Untested.

Added GRS-1 encoders/decoders to the service-level API. Lightly tested.
Test-client will ask for and print GRS1. Ztest will return dummy records
on request.

Added Extended Services: Item Order encoders and decoders to the Service-
level API. Untested. Would anyone be willing to fax or mail the pertinent
bits of the ILL protocol to us?

Moved pretty-printing of structure-wrappers ({..}) from odr_seq.c to
odr_cons.c, which causes a more correct output.

Fixed handling of searchRequest in frontend server. NextResultSetPosition
was always set to 0 when no records were requested in the searchRequest.

* Added better external-handling. This shouldn't harm old code that *encodes*
externals. It can break code that looks for a 'single-ASN1-type'
representation, since those types that are known are now decoded
immediately. Look at the SUTRS sample code in seshigh.c and client.c.
Documentation updated.

Better, but backwards-compatible handling of records in bend_fetchresponse.
Length -1 marks structured record, type is deduced from format field.

Fairly quick maintenance release to add SUTRS support.

Fixed handling of SUTRS records in the demonstration client.

* Added format field to the bend_fetchrequest and bend_fetchresponce
structures of the backend API (frontend server). When the record is
returned, the value of the format field is mapped to an OID. The
value VAL_SUTRS will also cause a slightly different ASN.1 packaging
of the record. The special value VAL_NONE in the bend_request means
that no specific format was requested by the client. Documentation
updated accordingly. Test server (ztest) will return a fixed dummy
SUTRS record if your client requests SUTRS.

Documentation updated accordingly.

You can now set external libraries and RANLIB support in the top-level
Makefile.
