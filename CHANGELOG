Possible compatibility problems with earlier versions marked with '*'.

--- XXXXXXXXXXXXX

Fixed tagging bug of type 101 query in SearchRequest-Query PDU encoder/decoder.

Fixed tagging bug in ResourceReportResponse PDU encoder/decode.

Added SOIF syntax (using private OID for now) to retrieval module and client.

--- 1.2 1996/6/10 (1st anniversary release)

Added Summary record syntax. Lightly tested.

Added OPAC record syntax. Untested.

Added ResourceReport service encoders/decoders. Untested.

Fixed bug in z_Unit - wrong tagging on unitSystem.

Fixed bug in the DiagRecs decoder.

Added options for max PDU size and session timeout to frontend-server.

Added documentation of query-language parsers and other supporting utilities.

[frontend-server] Added Attribute set to the bend_scanrequest API.

[frontend-server] NextResultSetPosition was sometimes set incorrectly when
surrogate diagnostics were generated.

[retrieval] Allow multiple local values for attribute.

[retrieval] Allow multiple attributes per element in .abs files. index type.

[retrieval] Added Summary tagset, abstract syntax, and d1-node/ASN filter.

--- 1.1pl2  1996/4/10

Minor changes, mostly specific to Zebra's requirements (retrieval)

--- 1.1  1996/2/20

Repaired bug in frontend server when running multiple listening
endpoints in dynamic mode.

z_External() now won't break if a known, ASN.1 value comes encapsulated
in an octet-string. The value will pass through unmodified in an Odr_oct.

Added a bit of code to the demo client to decode & display
ASN.1-structured records represented in the octet-aligned branch of
the EXTERNAL CHOICE. Thanks to CAS for prodding us to finally do this.

Added z_ext_getentbyref() to the ASN module. Doc updated.

* Completed the SCAN definition in the ASN module. This may break SCAN
code based on older YAZ-versions at compile-time. The fix is easy -
look in proto.h.

* Added 'displayTerm' and OtherInformation to the TermInfo structure
under the SCAN definition. Remember to initialize this, server-people.

Comstack should now support the WAIS protocol in TCP/IP mode. Note
that this does not extend to ODR and ASN.

Comstack allows insertion of established socket (primarily for
inetd-operation of servers). Doc updated.

Front-end server can now start from the inetd in TCP mode. Doc
updated.

--- 1.0pl4 1996/1/24

Added Sort PDU.

Fixed small problem in SUTRS-filter. A newline was sometimes inserted before
the rank and record number.

Adjustments to the frontend server.

Fixed diagnostic BER dumper. It ignored the file argument.

--- 1.0pl3 1996/1/2

Various changes to retrieval module.

Changed the union discriminators of the protocol files from enums to
ints paired with #defines.

*Changed oident.class to oident.oclass to avoid a reserved word in C++
 compilers.

*Changed operator in the RPN structure to 'roperator', again to avoid a
 conflict with C++.

Fixed problems in Explain decoders/encoders.

--- 1.0pl2 1995/12/6

Memory bug in log module fixed.

--- 1.0pl1 1995/12/5

Occasional malloc() of 0 bytes fixed in d1_espec.c.

Bug in Explain DatabaseInfo module fixed.

Some '\r' snuck into one or two of the ret'l config tables. A curse on Windows.

--- 1.0 1995/11/28

The shift to v1.0 signals that we now consider the *core* functionality
of YAZ reasonably stable (the core being more or less equivalent to
Z39.50-1992). Some of the really nifty v3 stuff is still not heavily
tested (Explain not at all - though that will happen soonish).

Minor changes to code to support Windows port.

Various minor changes after we're getting to use GRS-1 & co. more.

Added Espec-1 format.

Added VisibleString field body type to GRS-1. It is illegal acc. to my copy
of the protocol and it cannot be selected when encoding (maps into 'string'
when decoding). Needed to talk to some servers.

Demo client can request simple element set names.

Added Diagnostic Format encoders/decoders.

Added simple Close handling to frontend server (no hooks for resource
reporting yet), and demonstration client.

Added cs_addrstr() command to COMSTACK to retrieve peer hostname/address.

--- 1.0b3 1995/08/24

Fixed bug in the frontend-server. The numberOfRecordsReturned field was
handled incorrectly when records were requested in the searchResponse. This
will only affect you if you use the frontend-server.

Added GRS-1 encoders/decoders to the service-level API. Lightly tested.
Test-client will ask for and print GRS1. Ztest will return dummy records
on request.

Added Explain encoders/decoders to the service-level API. Untested.

Added Extended Services: Item Order encoders and decoders to the Service-
level API. Untested. We could use a recent copy of the pertinent bits
of the ILL protocol to add those bits.

Added diagnostic format 1 encoders/decoders to the service-level API.
Untested.

Moved pretty-printing of structure-wrappers ({..}) from odr_seq.c to
odr_cons.c, which causes a more correct output.

Fixed handling of searchRequest in frontend server. NextResultSetPosition
was always set to 0 when no records were requested in the searchRequest.

* Added better external-handling. This shouldn't harm old code that
*encodes* externals. It can break code that looks for a
'single-ASN1-type' representation, since those types that are known
are now decoded immediately. Look at the SUTRS sample code in
seshigh.c and client.c. Documentation updated.

Handling of structured records in bend_fetchresponse. Length -1 marks
structured record, type is deduced from format field.

--- 1.0b2 1995/06/27
Fairly quick maintenance release to add SUTRS support.

Fixed handling of SUTRS records in the demonstration client.

* Added format field to the bend_fetchrequest and bend_fetchresponce
structures of the backend API (frontend server). When the record is
returned, the value of the format field is mapped to an OID. The
value VAL_SUTRS will also cause a slightly different ASN.1 packaging
of the record. The special value VAL_NONE in the bend_request means
that no specific format was requested by the client. Documentation
updated accordingly. Test server (ztest) will return a fixed dummy
SUTRS record if your client requests SUTRS.

Documentation updated accordingly.

You can now set external libraries and RANLIB support in the top-level
Makefile.

--- 1.0b 1995/06/19
First public release.
