Possible compatibility problems with earlier versions marked with '*'.

--- XXXXXX XXXX/XX/X

Memory bug in log module fixed.

--- 1.0pl1 1995/12/5

Occasional malloc() of 0 bytes fixed in d1_espec.c.

Bug in Explain DatabaseInfo module fixed.

Some '\r' snuck into one or two of the ret'l config tables. A curse on Windows.

--- 1.0 1995/11/28

The shift to v1.0 signals that we now consider the *core* functionality
of YAZ reasonably stable (the core being more or less equivalent to
Z39.50-1992). Some of the really nifty v3 stuff is still not heavily
tested (Explain not at all - though that will happen soonish).

Minor changes to code to support Windows port.

Various minor changes after we're getting to use GRS-1 & co. more.

Added Espec-1 format.

Added VisibleString field body type to GRS-1. It is illegal acc. to my copy
of the protocol and it cannot be selected when encoding (maps into 'string'
when decoding). Needed to talk to some servers.

Demo client can request simple element set names.

Added Diagnostic Format encoders/decoders.

Added simple Close handling to frontend server (no hooks for resource
reporting yet), and demonstration client.

Added cs_addrstr() command to COMSTACK to retrieve peer hostname/address.

--- 1.0b3 1995/08/24

Fixed bug in the frontend-server. The numberOfRecordsReturned field was
handled incorrectly when records were requested in the searchResponse. This
will only affect you if you use the frontend-server.

Added GRS-1 encoders/decoders to the service-level API. Lightly tested.
Test-client will ask for and print GRS1. Ztest will return dummy records
on request.

Added Explain encoders/decoders to the service-level API. Untested.

Added Extended Services: Item Order encoders and decoders to the Service-
level API. Untested. We could use a recent copy of the pertinent bits
of the ILL protocol to add those bits.

Added diagnostic format 1 encoders/decoders to the service-level API.
Untested.

Moved pretty-printing of structure-wrappers ({..}) from odr_seq.c to
odr_cons.c, which causes a more correct output.

Fixed handling of searchRequest in frontend server. NextResultSetPosition
was always set to 0 when no records were requested in the searchRequest.

* Added better external-handling. This shouldn't harm old code that
*encodes* externals. It can break code that looks for a
'single-ASN1-type' representation, since those types that are known
are now decoded immediately. Look at the SUTRS sample code in
seshigh.c and client.c. Documentation updated.

Handling of structured records in bend_fetchresponse. Length -1 marks
structured record, type is deduced from format field.

--- 1.0b2 1995/06/27
Fairly quick maintenance release to add SUTRS support.

Fixed handling of SUTRS records in the demonstration client.

* Added format field to the bend_fetchrequest and bend_fetchresponce
structures of the backend API (frontend server). When the record is
returned, the value of the format field is mapped to an OID. The
value VAL_SUTRS will also cause a slightly different ASN.1 packaging
of the record. The special value VAL_NONE in the bend_request means
that no specific format was requested by the client. Documentation
updated accordingly. Test server (ztest) will return a fixed dummy
SUTRS record if your client requests SUTRS.

Documentation updated accordingly.

You can now set external libraries and RANLIB support in the top-level
Makefile.

--- 1.0b 1995/06/19
First public release.
